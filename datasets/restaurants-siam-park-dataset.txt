"Perfect After Siam Park"
Found this gem after exhausting day at Siam Park - only 5 minutes by taxi! The contrast from tourist restaurants is striking. Had the catch of the day (grouper) simply grilled - perfection. Rabbit in salmorejo is must-try for adventurous eaters. Portions generous and prices incredibly fair. Wine list features local varieties we'd never heard of - all excellent. Desserts homemade and delicious. Book ahead - we got lucky with cancellation. Service no-nonsense but friendly when not rushed. This is where locals eat for good reason. Skip hotel dinner and come here! Only negative: closed Sundays which caught us out second visit.

Sofia Martinez - February 2024 - Rating: 5/5
"Authentic Canarian Excellence"
El Cine proves tourist areas can have authentic restaurants. Ten-minute walk from our hotel near Siam Park led to this treasure. Goat cheese starter with palm honey was revelation - sweet and savory perfection. Shared grilled fish platter for two - incredibly fresh and well-prepared. Vegetables sides often ignored in reviews but here they're delicious. House wine fantastic and cheap. Atmosphere authentic without trying - locals chatting, families celebrating. Our waiter suggested dishes based on preferences - all winners. Prices felt like stealing for this quality. No English menu but staff helps. Absolutely worth slight detour from beach/resort area!

James Wilson - December 2023 - Rating: 4/5
"Local Favorite Worth Finding"
Hotel concierge recommended El Cine after Siam Park day - best advice of trip! Hidden location means no passing trade keeping it authentic. Menu handwritten in Spanish added to charm. Started with padron peppers and local cheese selection - both excellent. Main course fish stew was hearty and flavorful. Meat-eater friend raved about the beef. Dessert selection limited but flan was perfect. Service efficient rather than warm but that's the style. Prices incredibly reasonable for quality. Booking essential - fully packed on Tuesday night! Only downside: location requires taxi if staying at beach hotels. Worth every euro and the small effort to find it!

"Sunset Dinner Perfection"
After hot day at Siam Park, sunset dinner at La Vieja was perfect ending. Terrace table with ocean view worth requesting when booking. Started with oyster selection - pristinely fresh. Shared salt-baked sea bass for two - theatrical presentation and perfectly cooked. Sides of Canarian potatoes and grilled vegetables complemented without overwhelming. Wine list extensive with helpful recommendations. Yes, it's expensive but quality evident in every bite. Service professional and attentive without being intrusive. Watched sunset over La Gomera while dining - magical! Easy taxi from Siam Park area hotels. Treat yourself after water park day - you've earned it!

Antonio Garcia - January 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Upscale Seafood Worth the Price"
La Vieja delivers on location and quality though prices reflect both. Seafood paella was outstanding - generous portions of lobster, prawns, and mussels. Fresh fish display allows choosing your specific fish. Preparation simple but perfect letting quality shine. Appetizer of grilled octopus tender and smoky. House white wine excellent and fairly priced. Service very professional - English spoken fluently. Location in La Caleta provides authentic atmosphere despite tourist clientele. Only negatives: portions smaller than typical Spanish restaurants and bread charged separately (pet peeve). Still, for special meal near Siam Park, La Vieja delivers memorable experience!

Emma Robinson - November 2023 - Rating: 5/5
"Special Occasion Restaurant"
Celebrated anniversary at La Vieja after fun day at Siam Park - perfect choice! Restaurant arranged special table with rose petals without asking. Tuna tataki starter was art on plate and delicious. Grilled lobster for two presented beautifully and cooked perfectly. Vegetable sides often afterthought but here given same attention as seafood. Dessert of local cheese selection with fig jam wonderful. Staff paced meal perfectly for romantic evening. Yes, bill was substantial but experience matched price. Location in fishing village adds authenticity. Sunset from terrace worth timing dinner accordingly. For celebrating or treating yourself after Siam Park adventures, La Vieja is the choice!

"Culinary Journey Worth Every Euro"
Sebastian provides fine dining experience rare in beach destinations. After casual Siam Park day, we dressed up for extraordinary evening. Seven-course tasting menu was revelation - each dish artistic and delicious. Highlights included tuna with mango foam and local goat cheese soufflé. Wine pairings enhanced each course with Spanish and international selections. Service impeccable with detailed explanations of preparations. Chef Sebastian visited table personally. Yes, it's expensive (€150 per person with wine) but comparable to Michelin restaurants. Intimate atmosphere makes reservation essential. Only 8-minute taxi from Siam Park hotels. For food enthusiasts, this is unmissable!

Lisa Chen - February 2024 - Rating: 5/5
"Special Occasion Perfection"
Celebrated birthday at Sebastian after Siam Park adventures - study in contrasts! Restaurant's attention to detail extraordinary from amuse-bouche to petit fours. Opted for à la carte - portions smaller but richness means it's adequate. Foie gras preparation was best I've had outside France. Fish course (red mullet) with unusual vegetable accompaniments showed creativity. Dessert of chocolate variations was art. Service synchronized perfectly - never waiting or rushed. Wine list overwhelming but sommelier's suggestions spot-on. Bill substantial but experience unforgettable. Location requires taxi but worth journey. For gastronomy lovers seeking something special near Siam Park, Sebastian delivers excellence!

Robert Taylor - December 2023 - Rating: 4/5
"Exceptional but Not for Everyone"
Sebastian offers culinary excellence that may not suit all tastes or budgets. Tasting menu showcased technique and creativity though some combinations seemed forced. Standouts included beef course and cheese selection. Portions intentionally small following haute cuisine tradition. Service formal but warm when engaged. Wine pairings doubled already significant bill. Atmosphere sophisticated but slightly pretentious. Molecular gastronomy elements impressed though sometimes overshadowed ingredients. For special occasions and food enthusiasts, Sebastian provides memorable experience. For those seeking hearty meal after Siam Park, look elsewhere. Quality undeniable but style very specific. Reservation absolutely necessary given limited seating!

"Perfect Family Restaurant"
La Torre saved us after exhausting Siam Park days! Five-minute taxi ride to hearty meal everyone enjoyed. Kids menu extensive beyond usual nuggets. Adults shared T-bone steak - perfectly cooked and huge! Sides generous including excellent grilled vegetables. Sangria dangerously drinkable. Staff patient with tired children and brought coloring books. Roof terrace beautiful at sunset though we chose air-conditioned inside after hot day. Prices reasonable for quality and portions. They accommodated gluten-free needs without fuss. Became our go-to dinner spot near Siam Park. Reservation needed for terrace tables. Perfect combination of quality, value, and family-friendliness!

Mike O'Brien - January 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Solid Grill Restaurant"
Torre del Mirador delivers exactly what you want after water park day - good meat and cold beer! Mixed grill platter enormous and varied. Quality surprised given tourist location. Fish options fresh and well-prepared for non-meat eaters. House wine perfectly drinkable and cheap. Service efficient handling large restaurant well. Views from tower lovely especially at sunset. Only criticism: can feel like tourist conveyor belt when busy. But food quality and portions compensate. Convenient location between Siam Park and hotels. Prices fair for area. Nothing fancy but reliable quality. Kids running around didn't bother us but might annoy couples. Would return for unfussy good meal!

Jennifer Martinez - November 2023 - Rating: 4/5
"Great Value Near Siam Park"
Discovered La Torre walking from hotel to Siam Park - great find! Lunch menu excellent value at €12 including drink. Evening meals more elaborate but still reasonable. Steaks cooked perfectly to order. Seafood paella took 45 minutes but worth wait. Sangria best we had in Tenerife. Tower location provides nice views though surrounding area nothing special. Service friendly if sometimes overwhelmed. They handled our group of 8 well. Children's portions generous - two kids shared one meal. Gluten-free options clearly marked. Only downside: popularity means booking essential for dinner. For unfussy meal with good value near Siam Park, Torre delivers consistently!

"Authentic Thai in Paradise"
Thai Botanico transported us to Bangkok! After days of Spanish food post-Siam Park, craved Asian flavors. Garden setting absolutely magical - like dining in jungle. Started with proper tom yum - spicy and sour as should be. Green curry had authentic heat level (they ask preference). Pad thai among best outside Thailand. Portions generous without being westernized huge. Cocktails creative using lemongrass and ginger. Service attentive with Thai staff ensuring authenticity. Prices higher than local Spanish but worth it for quality and setting. Must book - hotel guests get priority. Easy taxi from Siam Park area. For Thai food lovers, this is unmissable!

"Beautiful Setting, Good Thai Food"
Thai Botanico offers unique dining experience in Tenerife. Garden location stunning especially at night with lighting. Food authentically Thai though spice levels adjusted for tourists (ask for Thai spicy). Seafood dishes excel given island location. Vegetarian options extensive and creative. Mango sticky rice perfect end to meal. Service mixed - some staff excellent, others still learning. Prices reflect hotel location but portions generous. Only criticism: limited wine list focusing on Spanish rather than wines complementing Asian food. Booking essential as restaurant small and popular. Location requires taxi but garden ambiance worth effort. For different cuisine near Siam Park, Thai Botanico delivers!

Lisa Anderson - December 2023 - Rating: 5/5

Celebrated anniversary at Thai Botanico - perfect choice! Garden setting with Christmas lights added was enchanting. Food authenticity impressed - chef clearly Thai trained. Tom kha gai soup silky and fragrant. Shared whole fish with tamarind sauce - generous and delicious. They accommodated pescatarian diet creatively. Cocktails expensive but creative and strong. Service professional with good English. Tables well-spaced for intimacy despite full restaurant. Prices higher than Spanish restaurants nearby but unique experience justifies. Hotel location means parking available. Only negative: mosquitos in summer require repellent. For romantic dinner or Thai food craving near Siam Park, highly recommended!

"Authentic Portuguese Gem"
Portuguese friend recommended Madureira's - now understand why! Worth 15-minute taxi from Siam Park area. Cataplana for two was enormous - prawns, clams, fish in rich tomato sauce. Espetada beef skewers hanging from stands theatrical and delicious. Portions huge - starter unnecessary. House Portuguese wine excellent and cheap. Piri-piri sauce properly fiery. Service warm and personal - owner checks every table. Prices incredibly fair for quality and quantity. Full of Portuguese families - always good sign. Only tourists were us! Pastéis de nata rivaled ones in Lisbon. For authentic experience beyond tourist restaurants, make the journey!

Jennifer Taylor - January 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Worth the Detour"
Madureira's provides authentic alternative to tourist area restaurants. Short taxi ride from Siam Park hotels enters different world. Portuguese codfish cakes starter enough for main course. Piri-piri chicken properly spiced and charcoal grilled. Accompanying chips hand-cut and perfect. Portuguese beer selection extensive. Desserts homemade including excellent chocolate mousse. Service efficient if basic - no frills approach. Language barrier exists but pointing at other tables works! Prices seem from different era - incredibly reasonable. Décor dated but clean. Locals outnumber tourists 10:1. Only negative: location requires transport. For genuine Portuguese experience near Siam Park, absolutely worthwhile!

Maria Santos - November 2023 - Rating: 5/5
"Home Cooking Away from Home"
As Portuguese expat, Madureira's feels like home! Visitors staying near Siam Park missing out if not venturing here. Bacalhau à brás transported me to grandmother's kitchen. Seafood fresh and prepared traditionally. Meat portions enormous - espetada serves two easily. Wine list features Portuguese regions tourists never encounter. Owner remembers regulars and treats newcomers like family. Prices reflect local rather than tourist economy. Yes, it's outside main tourist area but that's the appeal. Taxi drivers know it well. Booking advisable as locals fill tables. For authentic Portuguese experience, nowhere better in south Tenerife. Worth every minute of travel from Siam Park!

"Style Over Substance"
Monkey Beach Club delivers Instagram moments if that's priority. Food decent but overpriced for portion size. Sushi fresh but limited selection. Cocktails excellent though €15 each adds up quickly. Atmosphere depends on DJ - can be too loud for dining. Beach location undeniably beautiful especially sunset. Service varies - beautiful people get priority. Sunbed minimum spend policy annoying. Crowd can be pretentious during peak times. That said, experience unique in area. For special occasion or treating yourself after Siam Park, works well.
