"Perfect for Siam Park Visitors"
The free shuttle to Siam Park runs every hour and was so convenient - we went to the park three times! The suites are massive with full kitchens which saved us money on meals. The African theme is beautiful without being over the top. Rooftop pool at sunset is magical. Staff arranged early check-in when we arrived at 10 AM exhausted from overnight flight. Kids club gave us adults-only pool time. Yes, it's pricey, but the space and amenities justify it. The breakfast buffet is exceptional with made-to-order items. Walking distance to beach and restaurants too!

Michael Chen - January 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Luxury with Minor Flaws"
Baobab Suites is gorgeous with incredible attention to detail in the African theming. Our 2-bedroom suite was like a luxury apartment. The Siam Park shuttle is a huge plus - no parking hassles. However, the hotel feels a bit isolated if you don't rent a car. Room service is limited and expensive. The pools are beautiful but can get crowded when hotel is full. Loved the welcome drink and fruit basket. The rooftop restaurant is a must-try but book ahead. Overall excellent for families wanting luxury near Siam Park, just be prepared for resort prices on everything.

Emma Thompson - November 2023 - Rating: 5/5
"Best Family Hotel in Tenerife"
Traveled with 3 kids aged 5-12 and this hotel was perfect! The suite's kitchen meant we could have breakfast before Siam Park opening. Free shuttle runs from 9 AM - kids could go back for lunch and return. The kids club is fantastic with African drumming and craft activities. Multiple pools mean always finding a quiet spot. Beach is 10-minute walk with beach club service. Staff remembers your name and preferences. Yes, it's expensive but compared to getting 2 hotel rooms elsewhere plus taxi costs to Siam Park, it's actually good value. The African theme made kids feel like they were on safari!

"All-Inclusive Excellence Near Siam Park"
The shuttle to Siam Park during Easter holidays was brilliant - ran 3 times daily. All-inclusive quality exceeded expectations with genuine variety at buffets and à la carte restaurants included. Beach location is unbeatable with loungers always available. Our room with sea view was spotless and modern after renovation. Kids club kept our 7-year-old entertained with new friends. Adults-only pool area was a peaceful retreat. Staff went above and beyond - concierge booked our Siam Park tickets with hotel discount. Evening shows were actually entertaining! Only negative was parking (€15/day) but we didn't need car with the shuttles.

Lisa Martinez - February 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Great Resort with Some Considerations"
Iberostar Anthelia is a quality resort that shows its experience in hospitality. Pools are heated in winter which was essential in February. The Siam Park shuttle wasn't running off-season, but hotel called taxis quickly (€15 each way). Food quality is good for all-inclusive, especially the Italian restaurant. Beach location means constant breeze - bring layers for evening. Some areas still show age despite renovation. The spa is pricey but treatments were excellent. Family room was spacious with separate kids' area. WiFi worked well everywhere. Great value compared to similar 5-star properties, just don't expect ultra-modern throughout.

David Park - December 2023 - Rating: 5/5
"Perfect Christmas at Anthelia"
Spent Christmas week and it was magical! Special Siam Park package included tickets and transport - great deal. Christmas dinner was spectacular with seafood and traditional options. Heated pools meant swimming every day despite December. Kids club had special holiday activities including visit from Spanish Santa. Location is perfect - walk to restaurants and shops but beachfront tranquility. Room upgrade to Star Prestige was worth it for exclusive pool and better location. Staff speaks excellent English and remembered dietary requirements. Only stayed 5 nights but wished we booked a week. Taxi to Siam Park was quick when shuttle wasn't running.

"Adults-Only Paradise Near Siam Park"
While this is adults-only, it's perfect for couples who want luxury after Siam Park thrills. Hotel provides taxi vouchers making the 5-minute ride free. Returning to this oasis after the park crowds was heaven. The infinity pool overlooking the ocean is stunning. Food is exceptional - the Japanese restaurant rivals anything in London. Spa treatment soothed our water park aches. Gardens are immaculate with hidden seating areas. Room was palatial with huge bathroom and sea view. Yes, it's expensive but the quality shows in every detail. Beach club service at Playa del Duque included. Perfect blend of adventure and relaxation!

Victoria Hughes - January 2024 - Rating: 5/5
"Luxurious Base for Tenerife Exploration"
Jardines de Nivaria sets the standard for luxury in Tenerife. Used it as base for Siam Park (2 visits) and exploring the island. Concierge arranged everything including skip-the-line Siam Park tickets. Breakfast buffet is extraordinary with champagne and made-to-order options. Pools are heated and never crowded. The dress code for dinner maintains elegant atmosphere. Spa is world-class - book treatments in advance. Location is perfect - upscale area but easy highway access. Small touches like fresh fruit daily and evening turndown make difference. Worth the splurge for special occasions. Only downside is limited parking but valet handles it smoothly.

James Mitchell - November 2023 - Rating: 4/5
"Elegant but Formal"
This hotel is undeniably luxurious with impeccable service. Tropical gardens are like a botanical paradise. Restaurants are excellent though requiring long trousers for men at dinner felt outdated. Siam Park taxi service worked perfectly - doorman had cab waiting for return. Rooms are classic luxury rather than modern style. Pools are beautiful but no pool bar service - must order from restaurant. Being adults-only meant perfect peace but saw families turned away who didn't realize. Price includes quality but feels steep compared to newer properties. Still, the refinement and location near both Siam Park and Playa del Duque make it worthwhile for discerning travelers.

"Wellness Haven for Families"
Gran Tacande surprised us with its family-friendly wellness approach. Kids loved the pools while adults enjoyed spa time. Shuttle to Siam Park runs twice daily in high season - book seats at reception. Seawater pool is unique and therapeutic after park day. Healthy breakfast options were extensive including fresh juices and smoothie bar. Rooms are dated in style but very clean and spacious. Ocean view is spectacular especially at sunset. Kids club was basic but gave parents break time. Location requires car or taxi for dining variety. Great value for families wanting relaxation near Siam Park without party atmosphere.

Thomas Mueller - February 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Solid Choice with Wellness Focus"
The wellness angle sets Gran Tacande apart from typical Tenerife hotels. Spa facilities are comprehensive with reasonable prices. Siam Park shuttle wasn't running in February but hotel arranged group taxi for families (€5 per person). Heated pools essential for winter swimming. Restaurant quality good with genuine healthy options beyond typical hotel food. Room was enormous with large balcony though décor needs updating. Staff very helpful with attraction bookings and restaurant recommendations. Mini golf entertained kids. WiFi fast throughout property. Not luxury but excellent value with unique wellness offerings. Location bit isolated but peaceful. Would return for spa and proximity to attractions.

Sophie Laurent - December 2023 - Rating: 5/5
"Hidden Gem for Relaxation"
Gran Tacande exceeded expectations! The cliff-top location provides stunning views and cooling breezes. Loved starting days with yoga class before Siam Park adventures. Spa is fantastic - book the thalassotherapy treatment. Restaurant surprised with quality especially seafood. Our family room easily fit 2 adults and 2 teens. Free shuttle to Playa del Duque beach was bonus. Siam Park just €12 taxi ride away. Hotel feels boutique despite size with attentive service. Pools never felt crowded even at capacity. The wellness focus attracts calmer clientele. Great value compared to beachfront hotels. Only negative was limited evening entertainment but we preferred the peaceful atmosphere.

"Rock and Roll Family Paradise"
Hard Rock delivers on the theme without being cheesy! The lagoon pool is incredible - kids didn't want to leave for Siam Park! Speaking of which, the shuttle service (€8 per person) runs twice daily and was convenient. Music memorabilia throughout is fascinating. Our suite was huge with awesome sound system. Kids club has real instruments and recording studio - our daughter made a song! Restaurants range from burgers to fine dining all included in half-board. Evening shows were Vegas-quality. Yes, it's commercial and busy, but that's the vibe. The artificial beach means no sand in rooms. Worth the longer drive to Siam Park for the complete resort experience.

Amanda Foster - January 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Great Resort but Location Considerations"
Hard Rock Hotel is impressive in scale and execution. The music theme permeates everything thoughtfully. Pools are magnificent especially the Beach Club. However, location in Playa Paraíso means relying on hotel transport or rental car. Siam Park shuttle convenient but adds up for families (€32 for family of 4 each day). Food quality excellent with genuine variety. Room was stylish and well-equipped though not as large as expected. Entertainment team works hard with activities all day. Spa prices are rock-star level too. Overall fantastic resort but consider transport costs when comparing to hotels closer to Siam Park. The experience justifies the premium for music fans.

Nicole Chang - November 2023 - Rating: 5/of
"Exceeded All Expectations"
Wasn't sure about music-themed hotel but Hard Rock Tenerife is brilliant! Shuttle to Siam Park worth the fee for comfortable transport. The lagoon pool complex is better than some water parks. Restaurants are genuinely good - sushi, Mexican, steakhouse all delivered. Our teens loved the DJ lessons and gaming lounge. Younger kids adored instrument petting zoo in kids club. Rock Royalty upgrade provided exclusive pool and lounge making busy resort feel intimate. Room's sound system with Bluetooth was perfect for dance parties. Location seems remote but ensures resort feels complete. Beach Club with sand and waves means ocean swimming unnecessary. Expensive but delivers unique experience. Even non-music fans will love this place!

"Charming Alternative to Mega-Resorts"
Villa Cortes is a breath of fresh air compared to typical Tenerife hotels. The Mexican hacienda style with courtyards and fountains is genuinely charming. Location is perfect - quick taxi to Siam Park (€15) but walking distance to restaurants and shops. Beach access through gardens is lovely. Pools are smaller but never crowded. Food quality excellent especially Mexican restaurant. Our garden view room was spacious with character - not cookie-cutter modern. Staff provides personal service impossible at larger resorts. Kids club basic but sufficient. Only negative is road noise from some rooms. Perfect for those wanting boutique experience near major attractions.

Ryan O'Brien - February 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Character Hotel with Great Location"
The Mexican theme could be kitsch but Villa Cortes pulls it off with class. Recent renovation updated necessities while maintaining colonial charm. Beach location in Playa de las Américas means walkable nightlife unlike isolated resorts. Siam Park easily accessible by taxi or bus. Gardens are beautiful with mature palms and hidden corners. Restaurant by beach serves excellent paella. Rooms vary significantly - ask for renovated ones away from road. Pool area smaller than mega-resorts but comfortable. Entertainment low-key compared to Hard Rock style properties. Great value for 5-star rating. Perfect for couples or families wanting character over facilities. Would definitely return!

Linda Martinez - December 2023 - Rating: 4/5
"Unique Style in Prime Location"
Villa Cortes offers something different in Tenerife's hotel scene. The architecture transports you to colonial Mexico. Christmas decorations blended perfectly with hacienda style. Location brilliant for Siam Park (10-minute taxi) and walking to restaurants. Beach is rocky but loungers on grass are comfortable. Recently renovated rooms are lovely though some still need updating. Restaurants good value with half-board option. Spa small but treatments excellent. Gardens are the highlight with peaceful spots throughout. Service personal and friendly. Not for those wanting modern minimalism or huge pools. Perfect for travelers appreciating character and convenient location. Excellent value compared to nearby 5-stars.

"Renovation Transforms Classic Resort"
Mediterranean Palace has been completely transformed! Our room was modern and stylish - hard to believe it's a 1970s building. Location is unbeatable for accessing everything - Siam Park bus stops right outside (€5 return). Rooftop infinity pool is adults-only heaven with bar service. Kids loved the splash park and supervised activities. Food improved dramatically with renovation - sushi bar and steakhouse excellent. Beach is across promenade but loungers by pools better. Staff retained friendliness despite construction disruption. Only criticism is pools could be heated warmer. Amazing value after renovation - won't stay this cheap long! Perfect base for Siam Park and exploring.

Kevin Schmidt - January 2024 - Rating: 4/5
"Great Location and Facilities"
The renovation of Mediterranean Palace created a modern resort in prime location. Walking distance to everything in Playa de las Américas. Siam Park easily reached by taxi (€12) or public bus. New rooms are excellent with rain showers and modern tech. Multiple restaurants mean variety though buffet still dominates. Pools impressive but January meant only one heated. Kids facilities extensive including evening mini-disco. Spa reasonably priced with good treatments. Some construction still ongoing in outer areas. Service friendly though stretched during busy periods. Beach rocky but promenade walks excellent. Great value for recently renovated 5-star property. Location and facilities make this ideal for families wanting accessibility.

Rachel Turner - November 2023 - Rating: 5/5
"Excellent All-Around Resort"
Mediterranean Palace hits the sweet spot of location, facilities, and value. Renovation created contemporary resort while maintaining space and gardens. Multiple pools mean always finding sun loungers. Kids club fantastic with English-speaking staff. Restaurants much improved - Italian and Asian excellent. Walking to Siam Park unrealistic but taxi rank outside makes it easy. Promenade location means beach walks and restaurant choices. Our suite was huge with separate kids area. Entertainment varied from professional shows to bingo. Spa good value compared to other 5-stars. Only negative was occasional noise from promenade bars. Perfect for families wanting full resort experience with local access. Highly recommend!

Can't believe more people don't know about Jardín Tropical! The gardens are phenomenal - wedding photo worthy everywhere. Christmas decorations throughout gardens were magical. Renovated rooms fresh and comfortable with everything needed. Quick shuttle or taxi to Siam Park makes location perfect. Playa del Duque beach access huge bonus. Seawater pool unique and therapeutic. Restaurants surprisingly good - Mexican night was fantastic. Staff treats guests like family especially restaurant and pool teams. Kids made friends at mini club while we relaxed. Spa treatments reasonably priced in garden setting. Only complaint is rooms near road can be noisy. Exceptional value - we've paid double elsewhere for less. Already booked for next year!
